🐳 Docker Compose (Full Stack)
# Start the complete testing environment
docker-compose up --build

📊 Accessing Reports
After running with Docker Compose, access the Allure report at:
http://localhost:5050/allure-docker-service/projects/default/reports/latest/index.html

🛠️ Local Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nimrodwe/sunflower_automation_assignment.git
cd OrangeHRM

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate    # Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install

🧪 Running Tests
# Run all tests with Allure reporting
pytest --alluredir=allure-results

# Run specific test file
pytest .\tests\test_checkout_flow.py --alluredir=allure-results

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v --alluredir=allure-results

# Generate and serve Allure report
allure serve allure-results



keep in mind that on mac you probably will need to run: "brew install allure" if you face error regarding environment,
either way running with docker wont produce this kind of error.
